1st slide
- Okay lets talk about the fun part.
- So i will explain the product functions and the way it should be used.

- So this is the main view of our product.
  As you can see there are three buttons Add, Find and Clear.

- Add Button is to Search and select an image and it will display
  on the left side area.
  After clicking the find button, the program will go through all
  the pictures and display the matching output.

- image name and the path will also displayed 
  ,So that the user can verify again.

- the edge detection view is to get a better look at the hand gestures. and also for future use

- Clear Button

- Status

2nd slide

- Now i will explain how this program works.

- So we have used 2-D correlation method to  identify the similarity of the 
  two images that we are comparing at a time.

- In this given function returns the 2-D correlation coefficient between array
  s A and B.

- We are giving the images as arrays to those parameters.

- Correlation coefficient, returned as a numeric scalar.
  Data Types: double

- Correlation coefficient is between 0 and 1. and if it is one it means both images 
  are identicle

- Problems we are having right now,
	- We need to have both images in the same resolution.
	- the correlation limit we put was 0.85
	- We are also trying to develop the system using edge detection method,
	  it will be a better way to identify the gestures
